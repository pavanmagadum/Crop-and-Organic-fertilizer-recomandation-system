## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Screenshots:
1. **Consistency is key:** Use same browser window size for all screenshots
2. **Use sample data:** Fill forms with realistic data before capturing
3. **Capture at right time:** Wait for UI to fully load
4. **Check quality:** Zoom in to verify text is readable
5. **Name properly:** Follow the naming convention strictly

### For Diagrams:
1. **Start with templates:** Don't create from scratch
2. **Use color coding:** Makes diagrams easier to understand
3. **Keep it simple:** Don't overcomplicate
4. **Export high-res:** Use 300 DPI for print quality
5. **Save source files:** Keep .drawio files for future edits

### For IEEE Paper:
1. **Reference all figures:** Every figure must be mentioned in text
2. **Number sequentially:** Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.
3. **Write good captions:** Explain what the figure shows
4. **Place after reference:** Figure appears after first mention
5. **Check resolution:** Ensure figures are clear when printed
