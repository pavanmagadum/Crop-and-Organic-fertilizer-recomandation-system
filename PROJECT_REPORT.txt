6.1	Screen Shots

	Entry page for the AI based predicting of multi disease health risk






































Fig 6.1: Entry page for the Multi disease health risk It is general entry page for all users.

This screen that shows the main interface of the Multiple Disease Prediction System. It contains a simple Streamlit-based dashboard with navigation options, allowing users to choose which disease they want to check (Diabetes, Heart Disease, or Parkinson’s).
 
	Entry page for Diabetes disease prediction






































Fig 6.2: Entry page for the Diabetes disease prediction here users or patients has to enter Clinical input data .



This screenshot displays the page that where users can enter medical details like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, insulin, and age. Once the values are filled in, the user clicks on the Diabetes test result button to get results.
 
	Next page for Heart Disease prediction of the application



































Fig 6.3: Next page for Heart disease prediction of the application here users has to enter the clinical data to predict the heart disease.


This screenshot shows the heart disease module, where users enter attributes such as cholesterol, resting blood pressure, ECG results, maximum heart rate, and chest pain type.
 
	Parkinson Disease Prediction Page of the application





































Fig 6.4: Parkinson disease prediction page of the application here users has to enter the clinical data to predict Parkinson
disease.



This screen shows the Parkinson’s module where users input the features like jitter, shimmer, and frequency- related parameters.
 
	Result page of the page of the Diabetes disease showing person is diabetic
































Fig 6.5: Result page of the page of the Diabetes disease, after entering this input it is showing as the person is diabetic



This screen displays the prediction result after processing the entered data. It shows whether the person is Diabetic or Not Diabetic based on the trained ML model.in this it is showing as the person is diabetic
 
	Result Page of the Diabetes disease showing the person is not diabetic



































Fig 6.6: result page of diabetes disease showing after entering this input the person is not diabetic.




This screen displays the prediction result after processing the entered data. It shows whether the person is Diabetic or Not Diabetic based on the trained ML model.in this it is showing as the person is not diabetic
 
	Result Page of the Heart Disease Prediction of the application




































Fig 6.7: Result page of the heart disease prediction of the application, after the user or patients entering this input it is showing as the person is having heart disease




The system generates and displays the result indicating whether the person is at risk of heart disease or not, using the ML model trained on heart disease datasets.in this screen shot it is showing as the the person is having heart disease.
 
	Result or Prediction page of Heart disease of the application




































Fig 6.8: Result or prediction page of heart disease is showing that after user or patients entering this input the person are
does not having any heart disease



The system generates and displays the result indicating whether the person is at risk of heart disease or not, using the ML model trained on heart disease datasets.in this screen shot it is showing as the the person are does not having any heart disease.
 
	Parkinson Disease prediction page of the application
































Fig 6.9: Parkinson disease prediction page of the application is user or patients wants to predict parkinson disease they are to enter the clinical data to predict the Parkinson disease.



This screenshot shows that the user want to enter the input features like Jitter Shimmer and NHR and more input features to predict the Parkinson disease.
 
	Result or Prediction page of Parkinson’s Disease Prediction of the application




































Fig 6.10: Result or prediction page of the Parkinson disease, after the patients or user entering the input the result
shown as The person has Parkinson’s disease.



This screenshot shows the output generated by the Parkinson’s model, predicting whether the patient is likely to have Parkinson’s disease or not.
 
	Another Prediction Page or result of the Parkinson disease of the application




































Fig 6.11: Another or new value prediction page of the Parkinson disease of the application. After users enters the
input the prediction result is The person has Parkinson disease
