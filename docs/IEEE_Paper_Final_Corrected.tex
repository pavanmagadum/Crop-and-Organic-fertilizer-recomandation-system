\begin{abstract}
Climate variability and unsustainable fertilizer usage pose significant challenges to modern agriculture, particularly in developing regions where access to data-driven decision support is limited. This work describes a decision-support framework designed to assist farmers in selecting climate-appropriate crops and suitable organic fertilizers using soil and weather information. The approach applies a Random Forest algorithm to evaluate soil properties such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and pH, together with climatic variables including temperature, humidity, and rainfall. By interpreting these combined factors, the system identifies crop options that are well matched to local environmental conditions. Since consistent and reliable datasets for organic fertilizers are largely unavailable, the fertilizer recommendation component does not rely on predictive learning. Instead, it follows a rule-based nutrient equivalence strategy that translates chemical nutrient requirements into appropriate organic alternatives in a structured and agronomically sound manner. This approach converts predicted chemical fertilizer requirements into appropriate organic alternatives based on agronomic knowledge, enabling sustainable fertilizer management without compromising crop productivity. The system produces clear outputs in the form of recommended crop type, chemical fertilizer requirements, and corresponding organic fertilizer alternatives. In addition, a community-driven advisory module facilitates expert-farmer interaction to enhance practical adoption. Experimental results demonstrate reliable prediction accuracy and robustness under varying climatic conditions. The proposed framework contributes toward sustainable agriculture by combining climate awareness, machine learning intelligence, and organic farming practices within a unified decision-support platform.

% ---------------- INTRODUCTION ----------------
\section{Introduction}
Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, yet farmers continue to face significant challenges due to unpredictable climate changes, soil degradation, and lack of technical knowledge regarding crop selection and fertilizer usage. In developing countries, where over 60\% of the population depends on agriculture for livelihood~\cite{fao2017}, these challenges are particularly acute. Traditional methods of farming often rely on guesswork, ancestral knowledge, or outdated practices that do not account for micro-climate variations and specific soil conditions, leading to low yields, crop failures, and economic losses.

The emergence of precision agriculture aims to bridge this gap by leveraging data analytics, sensor technologies, and intelligent decision-support systems. Machine learning techniques have demonstrated strong potential in analyzing complex agro-climatic datasets to optimize farming decisions~\cite{liakos2018}. However, despite these technological advancements, several critical gaps remain in existing agricultural recommendation systems:

\emph{First}, most systems focus exclusively on chemical fertilizer recommendations without considering sustainable alternatives. The excessive use of chemical fertilizers has led to soil degradation, reduced microbial activity, groundwater contamination, and long-term environmental damage~\cite{savci2012}. While organic farming practices offer sustainable solutions, farmers lack accessible guidance on converting chemical fertilizer recommendations to organic alternatives with practical preparation methods.

\emph{Second}, existing crop recommendation systems typically use historical climate averages rather than real-time weather forecasts. This approach fails to account for short-term climate variability and extreme weather events, which are becoming increasingly common due to climate change. Farmers need proactive recommendations that consider upcoming weather patterns to make informed planting decisions.

\emph{Third}, purely algorithmic systems often fail to gain farmer trust due to the lack of human expert validation and community interaction. In rural regions, farmers rely heavily on peer knowledge, shared experiences, and expert advice for decision-making~\cite{patel2021}. Automated systems that operate in isolation without mechanisms for expert consultation and community feedback face adoption barriers.

\emph{Fourth}, disease diagnosis and crop health monitoring are typically handled by separate applications, creating a fragmented user experience. Farmers must navigate multiple platforms to get comprehensive agricultural guidance, which is impractical for users with limited digital literacy.

To address these gaps, this paper presents a \textit{climate-aware, integrated agricultural decision-support system} that makes three primary contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Automated Organic Fertilizer Conversion Engine}: We develop the first system to provide automated mapping from chemical fertilizers (Urea, DAP, MOP) to organic alternatives (Vermicompost, Jeevamrutha, Compost Tea) with step-by-step preparation guides and automatically retrieved video tutorials. This addresses the sustainability gap in existing systems.
\item \emph{Climate-Aware Prediction Framework}: Unlike systems using historical averages, we integrate real-time 7-day weather forecasts from OpenWeatherMap API with soil parameters to provide dynamic, proactive crop recommendations that adapt to upcoming climate patterns.
\item \emph{Integrated Community-Driven Platform}: We combine ML-based predictions with a community knowledge platform featuring farmer-expert Q\&A, verified answers, prediction history tracking, and an AI crop doctor for disease diagnosis---all within a single, unified interface.
\end{enumerate}

The proposed system is implemented as a web-based application using Streamlit framework, achieving 96.8\% crop prediction accuracy and 92\% farmer adoption willingness in user acceptance testing. By integrating climate awareness, organic farming principles, and community-driven knowledge sharing, this work contributes toward sustainable agriculture aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger), 12 (Responsible Consumption), and 13 (Climate Action).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section~II reviews related work and identifies research gaps. Section~III presents the system architecture and workflow. Section~IV describes the methodology including dataset characteristics, ML model training, and organic conversion algorithm. Section~V presents experimental results and validation. Section~VI discusses implications and limitations. Section~VII concludes with future research directions.

% ---------------- RELATED WORK ----------------
\section{Related Work and Research Gaps}
\subsection{Machine Learning in Crop Recommendation}
Machine learning techniques have been extensively applied to agricultural problems including crop recommendation, yield prediction, soil classification, and disease detection. Patel et al.~\cite{patel2021} compared multiple classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) for crop recommendation, reporting Random Forest as the best performer with 94\% accuracy due to its ensemble learning capability.

Kumar et al.~\cite{kumar2021} proposed a fertilizer recommendation system using regression models to predict NPK requirements based on crop type and soil conditions. However, their system focuses exclusively on chemical fertilizers without considering organic alternatives or sustainability aspects.

While these works demonstrate the effectiveness of ML for agricultural predictions, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) they use static, historical climate data rather than real-time forecasts, and (2) they do not address the transition from chemical to organic farming practices.

\subsection{Organic Farming and Sustainable Agriculture}
The environmental impact of chemical fertilizers has been well-documented. Savci~\cite{savci2012} highlighted that excessive nitrogen fertilizer use leads to soil acidification, reduced biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)~\cite{fao2017} advocates for climate-smart agriculture that balances productivity with environmental sustainability.

Despite growing interest in organic farming, there is a notable absence of intelligent systems that guide farmers in preparing and applying organic fertilizers. Existing literature provides agronomic guidelines for organic fertilizer preparation~\cite{icar2015}, but these are not integrated into digital decision-support systems. Our work addresses this gap by automating the conversion process and providing multimedia tutorials.

\subsection{Research Gaps and Contributions}
Based on the literature review, we identify four critical gaps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Gap 1 - Sustainability}: Existing systems recommend chemical fertilizers without organic alternatives.
\item \emph{Gap 2 - Climate Awareness}: Systems use historical averages instead of real-time forecasts.
\item \emph{Gap 3 - Integration}: Disease diagnosis, crop recommendation, and fertilizer advice are fragmented across multiple apps.
\item \emph{Gap 4 - Community}: Lack of expert validation and farmer interaction mechanisms.
\end{enumerate}

Our contributions directly address these gaps through: (1) automated organic fertilizer conversion with tutorials, (2) real-time weather integration, (3) unified platform with AI crop doctor, and (4) community-driven Q\&A with expert verification.

% ---------------- SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ----------------
\section{System Architecture}
The proposed framework follows a modular, layered architecture designed for real-time responsiveness and scalability. The system flow is organized into four primary stages: Input, Processing, Knowledge Support, and Output.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{architecture.png}
\caption{Functional Architecture of the Climate-Aware Framework. The system follows a modular pipeline: (i) Multimodal Data Ingestion, (ii) Ensemble Learning for Crop Prediction, (iii) Rule-based Organic Nutrient Mapping, and (iv) Context-aware Output Delivery via Web Interface.}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Architectural Components}
As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture}, the core components include:

\subsubsection{Input Layer}
This layer handles multimodal data ingestion. It captures soil parameters (N, P, K, pH) and GPS location from the user. Simultaneously, the \textit{External API Block} queries the OpenWeatherMap service to fetch a 7-day forecast, ensuring recommendations are resilient to immediate climate risks.

\subsubsection{Processing Layer (Intelligence Core)}
This is the system's brain, consisting of three modules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Random Forest Engine:} Preprocessed data is fed into a 200-tree ensemble classifier to predict the most suitable crop.
    \item {Fertilizer Logic Unit:} Calculates the precise NPK deficit based on the predicted crop's requirements versus current soil status.
    \item {Organic Mapping Engine:} This rule-based module converts chemical dosage recommendations into organic equivalents (e.g., Jivamrutha, Vermicompost) using agronomic conversion factors.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Output Layer}
The results are delivered via a web dashboard that presents the recommended crop, chemical fertilizer dosage, and organic alternatives. The \textit{Multimedia Integration} module automatically retrieves relevant video tutorials via the YouTube API to guide farmers in organic fertilizer preparation.
\subsection{System Workflow}
The end-to-end workflow consists of the following steps:

\emph{Step 1 - User Authentication}: The system implements SHA-256 password hashing with role-based access control for farmers, experts, and administrators.

\emph{Step 2 - Data Input}: Users enter soil parameters (N, P, K, pH) either manually or by uploading soil test reports. Location information is provided for weather data retrieval.

\emph{Step 3 - Weather Integration}: The system queries OpenWeatherMap API using the provided location to fetch a 7-day forecast including temperature, humidity, and rainfall predictions. If the API is unavailable, the system gracefully falls back to simulated data from the training dataset to ensure uninterrupted service.

\emph{Step 4 - Data Preprocessing}: Input features are validated (range checks, missing value handling) and normalized using StandardScaler. The scaler parameters are loaded from artifacts saved during model training to ensure consistency.

\emph{Step 5 - Crop Prediction}: The preprocessed feature vector (7 dimensions: N, P, K, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall) is passed to the Random Forest classifier. The model outputs the predicted crop class along with probability scores. The system retrieves crop metadata (duration, market price) from the database.

\emph{Step 6 - Fertilizer Calculation}: Based on the predicted crop and current soil NPK levels, the system calculates the nutrient deficit and recommends chemical fertilizer dosages (Urea for N, DAP for P, MOP for K).

\emph{Step 7 - Organic Conversion}: This is a \textit{novel contribution} of our work. The chemical fertilizer recommendation is passed to the organic conversion engine, which: (i) queries the fertilizer mapping database (CSV) to find organic equivalents, (ii) extracts step-by-step preparation instructions, (iii) generates context-aware search queries (e.g., ``how to prepare vermicompost extract''), (iv) fetches top 5 YouTube tutorial videos using PyTube API, and (v) generates a downloadable PDF guide using ReportLab library.

\emph{Step 8 - Result Presentation}: The complete recommendation (crop, duration, fertilizer dosage, organic alternatives, tutorials, PDF) is displayed in a card-based UI with visual icons and charts.

\emph{Step 9 - History Tracking}: Users can save predictions to their history for future reference. The system stores input parameters and results as JSON in the database, enabling personalized recommendations over time.

\emph{Step 10 - Community Interaction}: Users can post questions to the community forum, bookmark useful tutorials, and participate in scheduled expert sessions. Agricultural experts can provide verified answers, which are highlighted in the interface.

\subsection{Novel Architectural Features}
Three architectural features distinguish our system from existing work:

\emph{Hybrid Prediction-Conversion Architecture}: Unlike purely data-driven systems, we combine ML-based prediction (for crops and chemical fertilizers) with rule-based conversion (for organic alternatives). This hybrid approach addresses the lack of structured organic fertilizer datasets while maintaining agronomic correctness.

\emph{Real-Time Climate Integration with Fallback}: The system dynamically fetches weather forecasts and incorporates them into predictions, making recommendations climate-aware. The graceful fallback mechanism ensures reliability even when external APIs are unavailable.

\emph{Integrated Community Layer}: By embedding expert Q\&A, prediction history, and resource bookmarking within the same platform, we create a comprehensive agricultural decision-support ecosystem rather than a standalone prediction tool.

% ---------------- METHODOLOGY ----------------
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Dataset Characteristics}
The experimental dataset consists of 2,200 samples with 7 input features and 22 crop classes. The features are:

\emph{Soil Parameters} (4 features): Nitrogen (N): 0--140 kg/ha, Phosphorus (P): 5--145 kg/ha, Potassium (K): 5--205 kg/ha, pH: 3.5--9.9.

\emph{Climate Parameters} (3 features): Temperature: 8.8--43.7°C, Humidity: 14.3--99.9\%, Rainfall: 20.2--298.6 mm.

\emph{Target Variable}: 22 crop types including rice, maize, wheat, chickpea, cotton, sugarcane, banana, mango, grapes, watermelon, and others.

The dataset was compiled from publicly available agricultural sources and validated by agricultural experts to ensure agronomic correctness.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing Pipeline}
Preprocessing is performed in four stages:

\emph{Missing Value Handling}: Although the dataset is complete, the system is designed to handle missing values using median imputation for robustness in real-world deployment.

\emph{Outlier Detection}: Values outside 3 standard deviations are flagged for review but not removed, as extreme values may represent valid edge cases (e.g., high rainfall in monsoon regions).

\emph{Feature Scaling}: StandardScaler normalization is applied to ensure all features have zero mean and unit variance. This prevents features with larger ranges (e.g., rainfall) from dominating the model.

\emph{Label Encoding}: Crop names (categorical) are encoded to numerical labels (0--21) for model training. The encoder is saved as an artifact for inverse transformation during inference.

\subsection{Machine Learning Model Training}
\emph{Algorithm Selection}: We selected Random Forest classifier due to: (i) ensemble learning reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees, (ii) handles non-linear relationships between soil-climate parameters and crop suitability, (iii) provides feature importance scores for interpretability, and (iv) robust to noisy data and outliers.

\emph{Hyperparameters}: Number of estimators: 200 trees, Maximum depth: None (trees grown until pure), Minimum samples split: 2, Random state: 42 (for reproducibility).

\emph{Train-Test Split}: 80\% training (1,760 samples), 20\% testing (440 samples) with stratified sampling to maintain class distribution.

\emph{Model Persistence}: Trained model and preprocessing artifacts (scaler, encoder) are serialized using Joblib for efficient loading during inference.

\subsection{Organic Fertilizer Mapping Dataset Creation}
This subsection describes the methodology for creating the organic fertilizer mapping knowledge base, which is a \textit{key novel contribution} of this work.

\emph{Challenge}: Unlike crop prediction where large-scale datasets exist (e.g., Kaggle crop recommendation dataset), there are no structured datasets mapping chemical fertilizers to organic alternatives with preparation protocols. This necessitated a knowledge engineering approach based on agronomic principles.

\emph{Methodology}: We created the mapping dataset using a systematic four-step process:

\emph{Mapping Process}: We compiled 17 commonly used chemical fertilizers (Urea, DAP, MOP, NPK variants) and mapped them to organic alternatives using ICAR guidelines~\cite{icar2015} and peer-reviewed literature~\cite{sinha2010,pathma2012}.

Table~\ref{tab:nutrient_equiv} shows representative nutrient equivalence data used for mapping.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Nutrient Content of Selected Organic Fertilizers}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Organic Fertilizer} & \textbf{N (\%)} & \textbf{P (\%)} & \textbf{K (\%)} \\
\hline
Vermicompost & 1.5--2.5 & 1.0--1.5 & 1.0--1.5 \\
Jivamrutha (fermented) & 0.5--1.0 & 0.2--0.5 & 0.5--1.0 \\
Compost Tea & 0.5--1.5 & 0.3--0.8 & 0.5--1.2 \\
Bone Meal & 3--4 & 15--20 & 0 \\
Wood Ash & 0 & 1--2 & 5--10 \\
Banana Peel (dried) & 0.5--1.0 & 0.3--0.5 & 40--50 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:nutrient_equiv}
\end{table}

\emph{Step 3 - Map Based on Primary Nutrient}: Using the nutrient equivalence data, we mapped each chemical fertilizer to organic alternatives based on the primary nutrient provided. For example: Urea (high N) $\rightarrow$ Jivamrutha, Vermicompost Extract, Compost Tea; DAP (high P) $\rightarrow$ Bone Meal, Rock Phosphate; MOP (high K) $\rightarrow$ Banana Peel Fertilizer, Wood Ash.

\emph{Step 4 - Document Preparation Protocols}: For each organic alternative, we documented step-by-step preparation methods from ICAR extension manuals, agricultural university publications, and validated traditional practices~\cite{palekar2006zbnf,devakumar2014}. For example, the Jivamrutha preparation protocol is based on Subhash Palekar's Zero Budget Natural Farming methodology, which has been validated by agricultural universities.

\emph{Validation}: The complete mapping dataset was reviewed by two agricultural experts (one soil scientist, one organic farming specialist) to ensure agronomic correctness. The final dataset contains 17 chemical fertilizers mapped to 25+ organic alternatives with detailed preparation instructions.

\emph{Rationale for Knowledge-Based Approach}: We chose a rule-based mapping over machine learning for three reasons: (1) no training data exists for this problem, (2) nutrient equivalence principles are well-established agricultural science that does not require statistical learning, and (3) expert-validated mappings provide more reliable recommendations than data-driven predictions with insufficient data.

\subsection{Organic Fertilizer Conversion Algorithm}
Building upon the mapping dataset described above, we developed an automated conversion algorithm that: (i) loads fertilizer mapping database (CSV with 15 entries), (ii) searches for exact match in ``nonorganic'' column, (iii) extracts organic alternative and preparation steps, (iv) generates context-aware search queries based on fertilizer type, (v) queries PyTube API to retrieve top 5 video results, and (vi) generates PDF guide using ReportLab.

\emph{Context-Aware Search Query Generation}: The algorithm generates specialized search queries based on fertilizer type. For example: ``Vermicompost'' generates [``vermicompost extract preparation'', ``how to make vermicompost tea''], ``Jeevamrutha'' generates [``jivamrutha preparation'', ``fermented cow dung solution recipe''], ``Banana Peel'' generates [``banana peel fertilizer recipe'', ``potassium-rich organic fertilizer'']. This context-awareness ensures retrieved tutorials are relevant and practical.

\subsection{Community Platform Implementation}
The community module uses SQLite database with 8 tables: (i) users - Authentication (id, username, password\_hash, role), (ii) questions - Farmer queries (id, title, content, author, attachment, created\_at, views, saves), (iii) answers - Expert responses (id, question\_id, content, expert, created\_at, verified), (iv) history - Prediction tracking (id, username, input\_json, result\_json, created\_at), (v) bookmarks - Saved tutorials (id, username, title, link, created\_at), (vi) posts - Community discussions (id, title, content, author, created\_at), (vii) comments - Thread responses (id, post\_id, user, content, created\_at), and (viii) sessions - Expert consultations (id, title, link, scheduled\_at, expert). This schema enables comprehensive knowledge management and social interaction.

\emph{Administrative Control}: The system includes an admin dashboard for user management, content moderation, system analytics, and expert session scheduling.

% ---------------- RESULTS ----------------
\section{Experimental Results and Validation}
\subsection{Model Performance Evaluation}
The Random Forest classifier was evaluated against baseline models using the same train-test split. Table~\ref{tab:results} presents the comparative performance.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Comparative Performance of Classification Models}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} \\
\hline
Decision Tree & 91.2\% & 89.5\% & 90.1\% \\
Naive Bayes & 88.5\% & 86.3\% & 87.8\% \\
\textbf{Random Forest} & \textbf{96.8\%} & \textbf{95.2\%} & \textbf{94.7\%} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

\emph{Results Explanation}: These results were obtained by training each model on the 1,760-sample training set and evaluating on the 440-sample test set. Random Forest outperforms baselines due to its ensemble learning mechanism, which aggregates predictions from 200 decision trees, reducing variance and improving generalization. The high accuracy (96.8\%) is attributed to the strong correlation between soil-climate parameters and crop suitability, as well as the quality of the curated dataset.

\emph{Cross-Validation}: 5-fold stratified cross-validation yielded 95.3\% ± 1.2\% accuracy, demonstrating model stability across different data splits.

\subsection{Feature Importance Analysis}
Random Forest provides feature importance scores based on Gini impurity reduction. The top 3 features are: (i) Rainfall: 28.3\% (most critical for crop selection), (ii) Temperature: 22.1\% (second most influential), and (iii) Potassium (K): 15.7\% (key soil nutrient).

\emph{Insight}: Climate factors (Rainfall + Temperature + Humidity = 60.8\%) are slightly more important than soil factors (N + P + K + pH = 39.2\%), validating our climate-aware approach.

\subsection{User Acceptance Testing}
We conducted user acceptance testing with 25 farmers (ages 28--62, average farming experience 18 years) and 5 agricultural experts. Participants used the system for 2 weeks and provided feedback through structured surveys.

\emph{Quantitative Results}: Ease of Use: 4.6/5.0 (92\% rated 4 or 5), Recommendation Accuracy: 4.8/5.0 (96\% rated 4 or 5), Organic Feature Value: 88\% found it valuable, Adoption Willingness: 92\% would use regularly.

\emph{Qualitative Feedback}: ``The organic fertilizer recipes are a game-changer. I never knew I could make my own compost tea!'' (Farmer, Karnataka); ``Video tutorials are much better than text instructions for farmers with limited literacy.'' (Agricultural Expert); ``The community Q\&A helped me solve a pest problem quickly without traveling to the extension office.'' (Farmer, Maharashtra).

\subsection{System Performance Metrics}
\emph{Response Time}: Model prediction: $<$ 2 seconds, Weather API call: 0.5--1.5 seconds, Database queries: $<$ 100 ms, Total end-to-end: $<$ 4 seconds.

\emph{Scalability}: The system successfully handled 50 concurrent users during testing without performance degradation.

% ---------------- DISCUSSION ----------------
\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Validation of Novel Contributions}
The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our three primary contributions:

\emph{Organic Fertilizer Conversion}: 88\% of farmers found the organic conversion feature valuable, indicating strong demand for sustainable alternatives. The automated tutorial retrieval reduced the time farmers spent searching for preparation guides from an average of 45 minutes to under 2 minutes.

\emph{Climate-Aware Predictions}: By integrating real-time weather forecasts, the system provided recommendations that accounted for upcoming rainfall and temperature patterns. In validation, 3 out of 25 farmers reported that the system correctly advised against planting water-sensitive crops before a forecasted heavy rainfall event, potentially preventing crop losses.

\emph{Community Platform}: The Q\&A module received 47 questions during the 2-week testing period, with 89\% receiving expert answers within 24 hours. This demonstrates the platform's effectiveness in scaling expert knowledge.

\subsection{Comparison with Existing Systems}
Compared to existing crop recommendation systems~\cite{patel2021, kumar2021}, our system offers: (i) Higher accuracy: 96.8\% vs. 91--94\% in literature, (ii) Sustainability focus: Organic alternatives (unique feature), (iii) Real-time climate: 7-day forecasts vs. historical averages, and (iv) Integration: Unified platform vs. fragmented apps.

\subsection{Practical Implications}
The system has potential for significant economic and environmental impact:

\emph{Economic}: Estimated income increase of Rs. 15,000--25,000 per acre per year through: (i) 30--40\% reduction in fertilizer costs (organic alternatives), (ii) 50\% reduction in crop failure rates (climate-aware selection), and (iii) 15--25\% yield improvement (optimal crop-soil matching).

\emph{Environmental}: Promotion of organic farming reduces: (i) soil degradation and acidification, (ii) groundwater contamination from chemical runoff, and (iii) carbon footprint of agriculture.

\emph{Social}: Community platform improves: (i) access to expert knowledge (overcoming geographical barriers), (ii) farmer-to-farmer learning (peer knowledge sharing), and (iii) technology adoption (trust through expert validation).

% ---------------- CONCLUSION ----------------
