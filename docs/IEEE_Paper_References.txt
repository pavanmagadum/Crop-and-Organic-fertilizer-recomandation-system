HOW TO CITE IN YOUR PAPER
===============================================================================

In the "Methodology" or "Organic Fertilizer Mapping" section of your paper, 
you can cite these references like this:

EXAMPLE 1 - In Methodology Section:
-----------------------------------
"The organic fertilizer mapping was developed by analyzing nutrient 
equivalency between synthetic and organic sources [9], [10]. Traditional 
Indian organic farming practices such as Jivamrutha preparation were 
documented from established literature [7], [4]. The conversion ratios 
were calculated based on NPK content analysis and nutrient release rates 
as described in [3], [9]."

EXAMPLE 2 - In Related Work Section:
------------------------------------
"Several studies have explored organic fertilizer alternatives. Solomon [3] 
provides detailed NPK calculations for organic materials, while Magdoff and 
Van Es [9] present comprehensive nutrient cycling principles. Traditional 
practices in the Indian context have been documented by Palekar [7] and 
Ramamoorthy and Balasubramanian [4]."

EXAMPLE 3 - In System Design Section:
-------------------------------------
"Our fertilizer mapping database (fertilizer_mapping.csv) contains 15 
common synthetic fertilizers and their organic alternatives, compiled from 
multiple authoritative sources [1]-[7], [9], [14], [15]. Each mapping 
includes preparation methods validated through scientific literature [6], 
[16] and traditional knowledge [7]."

EXAMPLE 4 - Specific Conversion Example:
----------------------------------------
"For nitrogen supplementation, Urea (46% N) can be substituted with organic 
alternatives such as Jivamrutha (0.5-1% N) or Vermicompost (1.5-2% N) [7], 
[9]. The conversion ratio accounts for slow-release characteristics and 
microbial benefits of organic sources [6], [10]."

III. METHODOLOGY

A. Organic Fertilizer Mapping

The organic fertilizer recommendation module converts conventional synthetic 
fertilizers to organic alternatives based on nutrient equivalency analysis. 
Our mapping database was developed through comprehensive literature review 
[1]-[7], [9]-[16], combining scientific nutrient composition data [9], [10] 
with traditional Indian organic farming practices [4], [7]. 

For each synthetic fertilizer (e.g., Urea, DAP, MOP), we identified 2-3 
organic alternatives with comparable nutrient profiles. The conversion ratios 
were calculated considering: (i) NPK content of organic materials [3], [9], 
(ii) nutrient release rates (immediate vs. slow-release) [10], and (iii) 
bioavailability in soil [10]. For example, Urea (46% N) is mapped to 
Jivamrutha, Vermicompost Extract, or Compost Tea, with conversion ratios 
adjusted for the slow-release nature of organic sources [6], [7], [9].

Each organic alternative includes detailed preparation instructions compiled 
from established organic farming literature [1], [4], [7] and validated 
through government agricultural extension resources [14], [15]. The system 
provides step-by-step preparation guides and video tutorials to ensure 
farmer-friendly implementation.
